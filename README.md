# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project is a part of the internship tasks assigned by Skill Craft Technology. It involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to understand key patterns, missing data handling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Project Overview

The task focuses on the following steps:
1. Data Loading: Load and preview the Titanic dataset.
2. Handling Missing Data: Identify and impute missing values.
3. Data Transformation: Convert categorical variables into numerical values.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Descriptive statistics.
   - Analysis of survival rates by gender, ticket class, and port of embarkation.
   - Visualization of data distributions and survival trends.
5. Correlation Analysis: Investigate correlations among numerical features.

## Key Insights
- The overall survival rate was 38%.
- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate compared to males.
- Passengers in first-class tickets had the highest survival rates.
- Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg survived more compared to other ports.
- Most passengers were aged 20-40 years, with survival rates decreasing with age.
- There is a strong correlation between ticket class and survival rates.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Data processing and visualization.
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).

## Code Execution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
